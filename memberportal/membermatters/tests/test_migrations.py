Both are cheap to assert directly.

    """Pins where the case-insensitive screen_name guarantee actually exists.

    profile/0022 adds a functional UNIQUE index on LOWER(screen_name) in raw
    SQL, to close the race where the iexact pre-check passes but two
    different-case names both insert. Raw SQL is invisible to Django's model
    state, and that has two consequences this asserts together:

    - On SQLite the index does not survive even with migrations. A later
      AlterField (0023_alter_profile_phone) rebuilds the table, and the
      rebuild only recreates indexes Django knows from model state.
    - Under --no-migrations the schema is built from the models, so the index
      is never created on any backend.

    Which leaves exactly one configuration where the constraint is real:
    Postgres with --migrations. That is why the CI Postgres leg opts back in,
    and this is the test that would fail if that stopped being true.

    Verified against a live Postgres: with --migrations the index is present
    and a CaseTest/casetest pair is rejected; with --no-migrations it is
    absent and the pair inserts.

    Stated as current behaviour, not intent. When the underlying issue is
    fixed by expressing the constraint on the model, this test is what will
    fail and point at itself.
