"""Settings used by the test suite.

Layered on top of the real settings rather than replacing them, so tests
exercise the production configuration wherever it is safe to do so. Only the
handful of settings that make a test run non-hermetic — file writes, outbound
network, shared rate-limit state — are overridden here, and each override
below says which one it is neutralising.

Activated via ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`` in ``pytest.ini``.

# configures logging during setup, so on a machine without that path the test
# run dies at import time — before a single test is collected. Routing
# everything to a null handler removes the failure mode instead of papering
# over it with an env var. Loggers propagate to root here (the real config
# sets propagate=False per logger), which is also what makes pytest's caplog
# fixture able to see project log records.
