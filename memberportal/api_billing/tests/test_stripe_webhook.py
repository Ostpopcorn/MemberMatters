"""StripeWebhook — transport invariants and the signup-payment paths.

This file pins behaviour that is already correct, so that the renewal fix
landing on top of it has something to break against. The endpoint is publicly
reachable and unauthenticated by design, so the gate tests below are load
bearing rather than incidental.

Two conventions worth knowing before adding cases:

* Every side effect in the webhook is deferred with transaction.on_commit, and
  under plain `django_db` the surrounding atomic block is rolled back, so those
  callbacks never fire. Any test asserting on `outbox` or on activation must
  run the request inside django_capture_on_commit_callbacks(execute=True) —
  otherwise it passes vacuously.
* `invoice_schema` parametrizes over Stripe's two payload shapes. Anything that
  reads the invoice's subscription id should use it, so a future API-version
  bump can't quietly break one shape.
