"""Per-event handlers for the Stripe webhook.

`StripeWebhook.post` (api_billing/views.py) owns the transport concerns —
signature verification, the profile row lock, scoping and idempotency — and
then dispatches here. Each handler runs inside that transaction with the
member's Profile row already locked, so all external I/O (emails, SMS,
activate/deactivate, Stripe calls) must be deferred with
`transaction.on_commit`; anything synchronous would hold the row lock for the
duration of the upstream call and can blow past Stripe's ~30s webhook timeout.
